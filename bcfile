! This is a prototype file used to append boundary conditions to the simpleFEM Program
! As simpleFEM is programmed in fortran, an exclamationmark is used to identify a comment here too
! Comments need to be seperate lines 
! The file is tab seperated.
! First you need to specify the number of bundary conditions
! The format is:  nametag of affected boundary | BC type (1=natural, 2=essential) | value in x | value in y | value in z
!
! If the movement is unrestricted in one specific direction, specify that as null
!
